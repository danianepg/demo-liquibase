Even the free version of  [Liquibase](https://www.liquibase.org/)  looks powerful and offers rollback command,  **comparison between two databases**  and different file formats for migrations.

It also  **claims** to be able to compare Spring Entities with the database and generate a migration script from the differences. I have tested it but I was not able to get it working due to something that looked like a bug on Liquibase. Also, StackOverFlowâ€™s wisdom said that it is not a good practice.

It can be executed when Spring starts up the application, through Maven command and  [more](https://download.liquibase.org/how-to-run-liquibase/).

You can check on  [my demo project](https://github.com/danianepg/demo-liquibase)  the following:

-   Migration instructions on file  _src/main/resources/db/changelog.xml_
-   Liquibase configurations on file  _src/main/resources/liquibase.properties_
-   Maven plugin for Liquibase on  _pom.xml_

The main commands are below.

Liquibase also creates two control tables on the database where it is possible to watch the changes.
